# Iris Flower Classification

This repository contains a **machine learning project** focused on classifying Iris flowers based on their features using Python. The project was completed as part of the **Oasis Infobyte Internship**.

---

##  Project Overview

The Iris dataset is a classic dataset in machine learning. This project aims to:

- Predict the species of an Iris flower using its **sepal and petal dimensions**.
- Explore the dataset and visualize relationships between features.
- Build and evaluate machine learning models for classification.

The analysis uses Python libraries like **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, and **Scikit-learn**.
